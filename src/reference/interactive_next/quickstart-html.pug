    h2#html-introduction Introduction

    p Writing with pure HTML and JavaScript is the fastest and easiest way to get started building rich custom control experiences for Mixer. We'll cover setting up a project, making some changes, and running it on Mixer.

    h2#html-quickstart Quickstart

    h3#html-prerequisites Prerequisites

    p You first need to #[a(href='https://nodejs.org/en/download/, target=_blank') install Node.js] on your computer. This lets you run our build scripts and tools. You'll also need a decent code editor. We recommend #[a(href='https://code.visualstudio.com/' target='_blank') Visual Studio Code] as a powerful editor with great JavaScript support out-of-the-box.

    p After Node.js is installed, run the following command to install the miix command line tool:

    pre: code npm install -g miix-cli

    p miix is the tool you'll use for creating, building, and uploading bundles to Mixer.

    h3#html-create-a-project Create a Project

    p Open your command line in the folder you'd like to work in, then run the quickstart command:

    pre: code miix quickstart html my-first-html-project

    p This will automatically download the contents of the default bundle from its #[a(href='https://github.com/mixer/interactive-html-starter' target='_blank') Github repo] and install its local dependencies.

    p It'll create a subdirectory with your project name, let's jump in there!

    pre: code cd my-first-html-project

    h3#html-launch Launch

    p Run the following command to boot up the local development server:

    pre: code npm start

    p This will start the #[strong miix editor] and open your browser, where you should now see the barebones HTML starter. The miix editor will serve as your development environment - allowing you to make changes and instantly see them reflected in a simulated Mixer window. Every time you save a file miix reloads your control.

    p Now that you've got your development environment setup, let's look at what's going on in #[code scripts.js]:

    +highlightFile('javascript', 'reference/interactive_next/quickstart-html/basic.js')

    p Let's break the interesting bits down:

    p #[code mixer.display.moveVideo(...)] tells Mixer to move the video container so that it is 50 pixels from the edges of the stage. One of the coolest things you can do from a custom control is resize the video to make the experience you want!

    p #[code mixer.socket.call('giveInput', ...)] activates whenever you click on the "Hello World" text. This method sends a #[code giveInput] message down to the game client. We'll talk more about that later.
        ul: li: strong TODO: Link to the section on sending data to the game client.
    p #[code mixer.isLoaded()] tells Mixer that your control has loaded. It's best to do this when you're finished setting up and loading in any images or scripts. Viewers on Mixer won't see your control until #[code isLoaded()] is called.

    p In summary, we position the video on the stage, setup a handler to send custom data back to the game, and then tell Mixer the control is ready to be seen by the world.

    h3#html-make-changes Make a Change

    p Now that we've gone over the basics, let's make an overlay that automatically resizes itself to always be over the video - even when the browser window changes!

    .alert.alert-info Automatically resizing and adjusting to the size of the browser is called #[em responsive development] and is very important in building custom controls. You can read more in our #[a(href='/reference/interactive_next/best-practices.html') best practices].

    p Let's talk strategy: our goal will be to place a semi-transparent #[code div] completely covering the real position of the video, independant of the size of the browser window or the aspect ratio of the video source. To do that, we're going to use the #[code position()] api which provides a handy observable for the real position of the video. Whenever that updates, we'll move our #[code div] so that it aligns with the video position.

    p To start, let's add our #[code div] to the #[code index.html]:

    +highlightFile('html', 'reference/interactive_next/quickstart-html/make-a-change-01.html')

    p Next, we need to setup the handler for when the window position changes. Add the #[code handleVideoResized()] function to the end of #[code scripts.js]:

    +highlightFile('javascript', 'reference/interactive_next/quickstart-html/make-a-change-02.js')

    p Lastly, let's tie it all together. At the top of the #[code initMixer()] function add the following, which subscribes our handler function for updates and does the initial positioning of the overlay.

    +highlightFile('javascript', 'reference/interactive_next/quickstart-html/make-a-change-03.js')

    p All together, here's our #[code scripts.js] file:

    +highlightFile('javascript', 'reference/interactive_next/quickstart-html/make-a-change-04.js')

    p That's it! Go back to the miix editor in your browser (likely at https://localhost:8080) and you should see the overlay being positioned properly. Try changing the emulated device size in miix and watch your overlay resize automatically.
